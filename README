pymongoose
-------------------------

Pymongoose is a wrapper around pymongo - the python driver for MongoDB. 
The main motivation behind it was to find a way to define and maintain a schema in your application
in order to manipulate data. 

The reason behind the name is that it is partially inspired from mongoose, the mongo library for NodeJS.

Usage
-----------------------

Place in in your PYTHONPATH and, as a package, you can access it from any python application.
